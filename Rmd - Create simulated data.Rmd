## Data 

### Create simulated data Y1

```{r}
# Ouput vector Y is transformed in Y1 with some extra 1s based on a feature 
# The observations that with the 10% highest values of wm_preview_started (chosen arbitrarily) are 
# converted from 0 to 1

# original distribution of Y
summary(factor(Y))

# observations given wm_preview_started > 0
sum(X[,283] > 0)

# distribution of Y given wm_preview_started > 0
summary(factor(Y)[X[,283] > 0])

# convert observations Y=0 given wm_preview_started > 0 to 1
conditionMetIdx = X[,283] > 0
Y1 = Y
Y1[conditionMetIdx] = 1

# sanity check 
summary(factor(Y1))
```

### Train and test split 

```{r}
# Split Y1 in train and test set 
Y1train = Y1[Createddate<=split]
Y1test = Y1[Createddate>split]
```

Results are 6 different data sets - Xtrain, Xtest, Ytrain, Ytest, Y1train and Ytest 

### Data exploration

```{r}
summary(factor(Ytrain))
summary(factor(Y1train))

summary(factor(Ytest))
summary(factor(Y1test))
```

```{r}
# summary statistics of training and testing 
summary(Y1train)
summary(Y1test)


# sd
sd(Y1train)
sd(Y1test)

# diff:
mean(Y1train)-mean(Y1test)

# standard error of the mean
stderror <- function(x) sd(x)/sqrt(length(x))
stderror(Y1train)
stderror(Y1test)
```

```{r}
# Difference between training and testing set

# the null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no difference between the two means
# An “alternative hypothesis” (H1) is that there is a difference between the two means

# Wilcoxon test 
wilcox.test(Y1train,Y1test, alternative = "two.sided")
# does not assume normal distribution 
# not statistically significant, failed to reject null hypothesis
# no difference between the two means 

# t-test
stats::t.test(Y1train,Y1test)
# generally assumes normal distribution but it has been shown that t-test can tolerate deviations from normality when two distributions are moderarely skewed in the same direction 
# not statistically significant, failed to reject null hypothesis
# no difference between the two means 
```
